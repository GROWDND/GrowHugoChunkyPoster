          <p class="h4-heading">Accessibility Standards</p>
          <p>We have created our website to meet the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0 AA standards.&nbsp; We are currently researching and working to improve our website to be even sharper, clearer, and incorporate all of the best
            practices from HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript.&nbsp; We will never stop trying to improve access to our digital offerings.</p>
          <p class="h4-heading"><strong>Actions Taken</strong></p>
          <p>Some of the measures taken to make the The GROW website accessible&ZeroWidthSpace; include:</p>
          <ul class="ul-reset">
            <li>adding alt text to all images</li>
            <li>ensuring a minimum 4.5:1 color ratio for all text</li>
            <li>using descriptive text links and headers</li>
            <li>maintaining a consistent and predictable &ZeroWidthSpace;layout and organization</li>
            <li>eliminating all automatic content (e.g. pop-ups, auto-playing media)</li>
            <li>including a skip to navigation link</li>
            <li>using descriptive anchor text for links</li>
            <li>incorporating a focus indicator</li>
          </ul>
          <p>As well as several other measures.</p>
          <p>Beyond our existing remediation measures, we continually review our website to ensure we adhere to best practices in web accessibility.</p>
          <p class="h4-heading">Audit</p>
          <p>We have made repeated efforts to review and re-review the The GROW website to ensure it complies with WCAG 2.0 AA and the general best practices of website accessibility. Further, we voraciously research web
            accessibility best practices and methods to improve our knowledge and stay up to date on the latest news and information.</p>
          <p class="h4-heading">Legal Requirements</p>
          <p>Through our genuine and good faith commitment and devotion to accessibility, we believe we not only meet but exceed the digital accessibility requirements imposed by Title I, II, &amp; III of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and
            Section 504 &amp; 508 of the Rehabilitation Act.</p>
